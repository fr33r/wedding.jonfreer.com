				Jon and Emma's paths crossed in the fall of 2010 at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio where they both attended college.  Jon, seeking to become a member of a fraternity, went to a party where he was introduced to Emma, a Kappa Alpha Theta. Little did they know of the future they were to have together.
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				They remained great friends for the next couple years, until they had one unforgetful night when in uptown Oxford. When waiting in line to get into their favorite bar, Jon reached out and grabbed Emma's hand. She looked back at him with a big smile, and ever since they were destined to be together.
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				On October 6th, 2012, Jon and Emma officially began dating. It was Emma's senior year (Jon's junior year) and the two lived next door to eachother, quickly making them inseparable.
			</p>

			<img class = "section-icon" src = "img/icon/map3.svg"/>

			<p class = "six-column">
				Come May of 2013, Emma graduated from college and was making the move to Minneapolis, Minnesota for her first job. Jon still had one more year left, so they began the hard journey of being long distance.
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				Despite being over 750 miles apart, Emma and Jon made the most of the distance by making frequent visits to see eachother and daily FaceTime calls. 
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				Though the year was tough, it helped them treasure the little time they had with eachother each visit.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "section">

			<h1 class = "section-header">the move</h1>
			<img class = "section-icon" src = "img/icon/box39.svg"/>
			<hr class = "section-header-bar" />
			<p class = "six-column">
				Finally, the day had come for Emma and Jon to be reunited. After graduating and completing training for his job, Jon packed up his things and made his way to Minneapolis, leaving long distance in rearview mirror.
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				The couple were excited to be able to spend all the time they had with each other, and get back their days full of dates, dinners, and staying in and watching movies together.

			<p class = "six-column">
				Ohio is where the story of Jon and Emma began. They have shared so many amazing memories, some of their favorites being at Miami University and in Cincinnati. Jon wanted Emma to take a step back in time and experience their favorite memories all over again.
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				Jon wrote seven letters, each were tied shut with some string and addressed to Emma in script. He placed each of these letters at the exact place where they made their memories. He then had one of Emma's best friends drive her to each location, where Emma then had to hunt a bit to find her next letter.
			</p>
			<p class = "six-column">
				The final letter led Emma to a place at Miami that holds a special tradition; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upham_Hall_(Miami_University)">Upham Arch</a>. It was here where Jon proposed to Emma, and where they happily started their journey to become Miami Mergers.
